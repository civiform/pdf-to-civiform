You are normally required to provide this evidence within 20 days of filing your claim although additional time will be allowed if you have difficulty in obtaining the evidence. The following are examples of acceptable kinds of evidence needed in deciding if \"good cause\" exists:\n(1) A birth certificate or medical or law enforcement records which indicates that the child was conceived as the result of incest or rape;\n(2) Court documents or other records which indicate that legal proceedings for adoption are pending in court;\n(3) Court, medical, criminal, child protective services, social services, psychological, or law enforcement records which indicate that the alleged or absent parent might inflict physical or emotional harm on you or the child;\n(4) Medical records which indicate emotional health history and present health status of the caretaker or the child for whom support would be sought; or written statements from a mental health professional indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning the emotional health of you or the child;\n(5) A written statement from a public or private agency confirming that you are being assisted in resolving the issue of whether to keep or give up the child for adoption; and\n(6) Sworn statements from individuals, other than yourself, who may have knowledge of the circumstances providing the basis of your \"good cause\" claim. These statements may come from friends, neighbors, clergy, social workers, and medical professionals.\nb) Upon your request, the county social service office may assist you in obtaining evidence to substantiate the \"good cause\" claim;\nc) On the basis of evidence the county social service office will decide whether \"cooperation\" on your part will be contrary to the best interests of the child;\nd) The Child Support Enforcement will be asked to review the findings of the county social service office and to make recommendations concerning your \"good cause\" claim.

Some homes built before 1978 may contain lead-based paint that may be harmful to anyone living or working within the home, especially pregnant women and children. Such hazards may occur as a result of exposure to contaminated lead paint dust and paint chips. It is important that you understand these requirements when applying for a home improvement grant from the City of Jurupa Valley. Federal regulations (24 CFR Part 35) require any home built prior to 1978 that receives federal assistance for rehabilitation be assessed for the presence of lead-based paint hazards. To comply with this requirement, the City will fund the cost of the assessment by a licensed and certified contractor, after a completed application for the Housing Rehabilitation Program has been filed but before the grant is approved. The results of the assessment will become public record and filed with the State Department. You will be personally obligated to disclose the results of the testing to any potential buyer and/or the subsequent occupants of the property. As a participant in the City of Jurupa Valley Affordable Homeowner Rehabilitation Grants Program, I understand that I will be required to use safe work practices when stabilizing any lead paint that may be found on the property. I also understand that some methods used to control the hazards may not be permanent in nature and may need to be readdressed in future years. By signing this Notice, I hereby certify that: 1. I have received a copy of this Notice. 2. I have read and understand the lead hazard requirements contained in this Notice. 3. I accept these requirements and the related personal disclosure obligations as a condition of my application for the City of Jurupa Valley Affordable Homeowner Rehabilitation Grants Program.

I understand that I am a voluntary participant in this program, and if I am approved for the Lincoln LHCP, I and my household members and pets may need to vacate my residence for health and safety reasons for a period of time while lead removal activities occur. The extent of the lead remediation and the possibility of relocation will be based on the initial lead test performed by the City of Lincoln or their consultant and the Lincoln Lancaster County Health Department staff.\n3. I authorize and direct any federal, state, local agency, organization, business, or individual to release to the City of Lincoln any information or materials needed to complete and verify my application for participation and/or to maintain my continued assistance under the LHCP. I understand and agree that this authorization or the information obtained with its use may be given to and used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in administering and enforcing program rules and policies.\n4. I understand that blood tests to detect lead levels are encouraged for resident children aged six years and under before work begins.

I understand that I will be required to sign a deed of trust and a promissory note and that the deed of trust will be recorded against my property and that all with a financial interest in the property (i.e. contract holder, spouse, etc.) must also sign the deed of trust and promissory note. The deed of trust will be filed with the Lancaster County Register of Deeds for the amount of the construction contract. The deed of trust and promissory note will remain on file for three years after the project is complete and the property passes a lead clearance test. No payments will be collected, and no interest will accrue on the promissory note during this time unless there is a default. If there is no default, on or about the third anniversary of the signing of the deed of trust and promissory note, the deed of trust will be reconveyed, and no monies will be owed by me to the City.\n9. I understand that if I am buying the property on contract, I must ensure that the Contract Holder is able and willing to sign any deed of trust and promissory note as required.\n10. I have been given the opportunity to ask questions about the information requested in this application.\n11.

The DVSHE amount depends on the percentage of the service-connected disability as certified by the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs. A disabled veteran with at least a 70% service-connected disability will receive a $5,000 reduction in property’s EAV. A disabled veteran with at least 50%, but less than 70% service-connected disability, will receive a $2,500 reduction in property’s EAV.\nWho is eligible?\nTo qualify for the DVSHE, the disabled veteran must\n• be an Illinois resident who served as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty or state active duty, Illinois National Guard, or U.S. Reserve Forces, and who has an honorable discharge;\n• have at least a 50 percent service-connected disability certified by the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs; and\n• own and occupy the property as the primary residence on January 1 of the assessment year or lease and occupy a single family residence on January 1 of the assessment year and be liable for the payment of the property taxes to the county.\nNote: The property’s total EAV must be less than $250,000 after subtracting any portion used for commercial purposes. “Commercial purposes” include any portion of the property rented for more than 6 months.\nIf you previously received the DVSHE and now reside in a facility licensed under the Nursing Home Care Act or operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs, you are still eligible to receive the DVSHE provided your property\n• is occupied by your spouse; or\n• remains unoccupied during the assessment year.\nIs a surviving spouse eligible?\nAn un-remarried surviving spouse of a disabled veteran can continue to receive the DVSHE on his or her spouse’s primary residence or transfer the DVSHE to another primary residence after the disabled veteran’s original primary residence is sold, provided the DVSHE had previously been granted to the disabled veteran.\nAn un-remarried surviving spouse must occupy and hold legal or beneficial title to the primary residence on January 1 of the assessment year.\nDo I need to provide documentation?\nYour Chief County Assessment Officer (CCAO) will require documentation to verify your eligibility for the DVSHE. You must provide a disability award or verification letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs for the current assessment year and one of the following documents that is the original or a copy certified by the county recorder, recorder of deeds, Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs, or the National Archives Record Center.\n• Form DD 214 or separation of service from the War Department (military service prior to 1950); or\n• Certification of Military Service Form.\nYou can call the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs at 1 800 827-1000 to request a verification letter that specifies your “service-connected disability rating.” Any other rating is not valid.\nAn un-remarried surviving spouse of a disabled veteran, who previously received this exemption, must provide the following documents to transfer the DVSHE to themselves or to transfer the DVSHE to a new primary residence:\n• the disabled veteran’s marriage and death certificates; and\n• proof of ownership.\nWhen will I receive my exemption?\nThe year you apply for the DVSHE is referred to as the assessment year. The county board of review, while in session for the assessment year, has the final authority to grant your DVSHE. If granted, your DVSHE will be applied to the property tax bill paid the year following the assessment year.\nWhen and where do I file my Form PTAX-342?\nYou (including an un-remarried surviving spouse applying for the first time or for a new primary residence) should file your Form PTAX-342 with your CCAO by the due date to receive this exemption. Contact your CCAO at the address and phone number below for assistance and filing information with your county.\nNote: To continue receiving the DVSHE on your residence, you must file Form PTAX-342-R, Annual Verification of Eligibility for Disabled Veterans’ Standard Homestead Exemption, each year with your CCAO.\nIROQUOIS County, CCAO\n1001EASTGRANTSTREET Wail Aing T a Sdd Ere Kss A 60970 IL\n815 432 6978\nAre there other homestead exemptions available for a person with a disability?\nYes.

../corpus/counties/New York/Niagara/1 | Page NIAGARA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 5467 ....json:  "help_text": "This Department is prepared to assist you in the design of a proper onsite sewage disposal system to service your existing house. After a site investigation and soil percolation test on the property, this Department will provide you with a complete design of a satisfactory onsite sewage disposal system for your home. The design is based upon the daily estimated sewage flow, soil percolation test results, and site conditions.\nIf it is found that the soil on the property is too impervious, ground water levels are too high, or the property not large enough for the disposal of sewage through conventional subsurface leaching methods, a sand filter sewage disposal system or other alternative system will be designed.\nTo determine the ability of the onsite soil to absorb wastewater generated from your home it is necessary to conduct a soil percolation test. To perform the test it is necessary for you to dig at least two holes 12 inches in diameter and 30 inches in depth. Digging holes by hand rather than with a post-hole digging tool is recommended. The holes must be located on diagonal corners of the area in which the leach lines will be installed. This area will be no closer than 20 feet to the house foundation, no closer than 10 feet from any lot line and no closer than 100 feet to any well, or watercourse. The maximum length of any leach line is normally 60 feet. A typical leach field area is 50’ wide x 60’ long.\nAfter the holes are dug, it is advisable to loosen the earth in the sidewalls of the holes with a knife blade or some other sharp instrument. This will relieve the compaction of the soil, which occurs during the digging process. Approximately 2 inches of washed gravel or crushed stone should be placed in the bottom of the holes to reduce the scouring and silting action when water is poured in the holes. These holes should be thoroughly pre-soaked just prior to the day on which the percolation test will be conducted.\nAt least 20 gallons of water must be provided for each hole at the time of the test. A garden hose and bucket is sufficient. The pre-soak water and the 20-gallons left at each hole must be clean water containing no oil, rust, or other material that could possibly seal the soil and give an unsatisfactory soil test. Any attempt to change the test holes in order to affect the percolation test would be a disservice to the owner of the home and would immediately negate any design based on such falsified data.\nWhen the completed application is returned, and upon notification that the holes have been dug, saturated and water is available, this Department will arrange to conduct the test as soon as scheduling permits. A site investigation will be conducted at the time of the percolation test to try to determine if there are any factors such as surface drainage or private wells used as the water supply, which might have to be given special consideration.\nThis Department will then provide you with the design and all the required information to provide an adequate sewage disposal system to serve this property. This Department must also be notified when construction of the septic system begins. Investigations will be scheduled to see that construction conforms to design requirements.\nA three hundred fifty five dollar ($355.00) fee in U. S. funds must accompany all applications unless noted otherwise. All checks must be U.S. funds drawn on an U. S. bank and be made payable to the Niagara County Department of Health.",

The Privacy Act statement is on your application\nform.\nThis information, including your social security number, is used to find out which programs can help you, and is also used to find\nout how much money and other help you can get. Following are some other uses for the information:\n• Upon request of a law enforcement officer in certain circumstances, a local department of social services must provide\nthe address of Temporary Assistance and Food Stamp Benefits recipients.\n• In some cases, information you supply is used to form jury pools.\n• In some cases, information is shared with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (in the\nDepartment of Homeland Security). Note: Medical Assistance will not give the information you provided concerning your\nimmigration/citizenship status to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n• Information is used for child support purposes.\n• Information is shared with other states and agencies that provide similar assistance, in order to prevent duplication and\nfraud.\nWhenever you are asked for information, you must give it so that it can be used to see if you can get money or other help. The\nparts of law that oblige New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, New York State Department of Health and\nlocal departments of social services to get information about you and to verify this information are Sections 21, 132, 134-a and\n366-a of the Social Services Law and Section 1137 of the Federal Social Security Act.\nTo make sure you are getting the money or other help that you and your family are legally allowed to get, other people may be\nasked to confirm and add to the information you have already given us. For example:\n• To find out if you are or were working, and, if so, how much money you made, your name and social security number are\nsent to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, and also to known employers. In some cases your\nname and social security number may be sent to government agencies in other states to find out if you worked or got\nmoney or other help in those states.\nNOTE: If you are applying for or getting Temporary Assistance or Medical Assistance, we may give your children’s\nsocial security numbers to their non-custodial parent in order to enroll the children in their noncustodial\nparent’s health insurance coverage and, if necessary, to begin child support enforcement services. If you are\napplying for Medical Assistance only, we may pursue the noncustodial parent of your children for medical\nsupport only.\n• The Unemployment Insurance Division in New York State and similar offices in other states are asked if you are or were\ngetting unemployment benefits.\n• Banks may be asked to see if you have a bank account(s), or confirm that you have one and how much money is in your\naccount(s).\n• Schools may be asked to confirm that your children go there.\n• The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles may be asked if you own a car.\n• The Social Security Administration is asked for employment information and to see if you get pension or disability\nbenefits.\n• The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are asked if you are eligible for and/or in receipt of compensation\nand/or pension benefits.\n• The Internal Revenue Services may be asked about federal tax information (1099) if you are applying for or in receipt of\nTemporary Assistance, to determine your income or resources.\nPersonal privacy rights also apply to all Medical Assistance and Services applicants and participants.\nAll of the information you provide on a Medical Assistance application will remain confidential.
